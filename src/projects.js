    <h2>The Impact of Book Bans on LGBTQ Students</h2>
    <p>The number of book ban policies has increased in recent years. While supporters of these library rules cite parental rights and that removing sexualized content is necessary to keep accessible novels age-appropriate, civil rights groups and free speech experts argue that vague language within these policies serves as a disguise to target novels focused on LGBTQ themes. This also comes at a time when there are attacks against LGBTQ youth across all fields in education - access to playing sports with one’s identified gender, the teaching of queer history, pride flags in classrooms - and many LGBTQ youth struggle with mental health issues. This policy brief analyzes the negative impact of these library policies on the safety of LGBTQ youth and highlight why book bans are not the best way to protect students from “inappropriate” content.</p>
