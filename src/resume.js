            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill</h3>
            <p>
                I am a current sophomore at UNC-Chapel Hill pursuing majors in computer science and political science with a minor in data science. With these degrees, I hope to pursue a future Masters in Data Science and Public Policy - using data and technology to shape a more equitable and just society for all.
                I am involved with many extracurriculars and organizations, and enjoy learning and experiencing new things! I currently am involved as the founder and media chair for UNC's Affirmative Action Coalition, webmaster for the undergraduate student government, Chief of Staff for the Institute of Politics, treasurer for the Honors Carolina Student Association, outreach chair for Planned Parenthood Generation Action, and a TA for Girls Who Code.
                I also work as a teaching assistant for COMP110, UNC's introductory computer science course, and as a research assistant on congressional candidates in UNC's political science department. Finally, I am involved as a DEI Fellow in the University Office of Diversity & Inclusion, which involves work with the Undergraduate Admissions Department, and am engaged in the NC Fellows leadership program.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                My professional background is in political campaigns and field organizing, from local school board races to congressional. Recently, I worked as the field organizer for Democrat Ashley Ehaszâ€™s congressional race in PA-01, cultivating leadership skills through managing a team of 50 interns and overseeing upwards of 600 volunteers. I lead a robust field program that made over 80k calls to constituents, built a strong volunteer recruitment system, and uplifted young people and underrepresented communities of color across our district to get involved in the electoral process. I analyzed problems that constituents shared, and based on the issues facing our district, I developed strengths in conducting research on policy proposals, drafting responses to endorsement questionnaires, and working on campaign communications via social media and press releases. In such a fast-paced and chaotic work environment, I was able to further my organizational abilities, understand how to delegate tasks, be more independent, and pay extreme attention to details.
                I also have skills in teaching and research from my on-campus work positions, and am a quick learner open to studying anything I find a passion in!
